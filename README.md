# Basic Shell Scripting

Project for Operating System class at Texas Tech University, with professor Dr. Yong Chen.

All the scripts can be ran using the `./scripts.sh` command.

It will produce the `greeting_output.txt`, `displayinfo_output.txt` and `greeting_modified_output.txt` files, which corresponds to all the logs for the scripts `greeting.sh`, `displayinfo.sh`, and the modified version of the `greeting.s`h (which can also be found as `greeting_modified.sh` in the current directory).

The output for the modified version of `greeting.sh` is also saved in the `greetingmsg.txt` file as requested.
